# CrystalBlue
 App for validating HOCON config files.

### Features
- Load a HOCON config file to check if its valid. If it is, a message will display indicating this. If it isn't, the error message raised will be displayed.
- Enable and disable specific validation rules to run on your config file. An error will be added to the error table with where and what the issue is if any are found when the enabled rules are ran.
- You can reload the previously loaded file when you want to check if the file is valid again after making changes to it externally. You may also want to reload to check a file again when you have changed the enabled rules.

### How to download and run
- Download zip file
- Extract somewhere
- Run CrystalBlue.exe

### Want your own validation rules?
- If you want some different rules implemented into the base program, feel free to raise an issue and I'll consider it.
- If you want custom validation rules for your own projects, feel free to create a fork and add your own rules!
